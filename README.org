** Description

strategy_engine is a C program that computes the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium
for a given payoff matrix. Consider the following table:

| P2 \ P1 | x    | 1-x  |
| y       | a, b | c, d |
| 1-y     | e, f | g, h |

Given values for variables a through h, strategy_engine calculates x and y by
creating utility functions from the payoff matrix and taking partial derivatives.
